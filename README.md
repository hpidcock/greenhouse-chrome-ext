# greenhouse-chrome-ext

## What does it do?

Right now, only one thing. It makes chrome open any candidate's attachment in chrome. Tired of it downloading PDFs and opening them? Just view them in the same damn browser.

## How do I install it?

I just load the folder in developer mode. As I take no responsibility for this plugin, install it how you like.
